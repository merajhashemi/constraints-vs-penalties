### Setup
We use `uv` for installing dependencies. To install `uv`, please refer to the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Experiments
To run the experiments, you can use the following command:

**Concave Example**:
```bash
uv run concave.py
```

**Sparsity**:
```bash
uv run sparsity.py
```

**Rate Constraints**:
```bash
uv run rate_constraints.py
```
